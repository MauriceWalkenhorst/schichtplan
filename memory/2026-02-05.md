# 2026-02-05

- **System-Stability:** Fixed timezone issues; Walter now runs on Europe/Berlin time.
- **GitHub Sync:** Successfully restored all dashboards and established a central launcher (`index.html`).
- **Dashboard Upgrades:**
    - `project_status.html`: Live monitor for agents/tasks with auto-refresh. Updated with real tasks (Chromium Fix, Dashboard Sync).
    - `costs.html`: Detailed breakdown by model. Updated with real session costs (approx. 0.14€ for Feb 5th).
    - `weather_card.html`: Redesigned for mobile/glass look with dynamic location logic.
    - `film_duel_imdb100.html`: Completely optimized for mobile. Added horizontal swipe/slide layout to prevent scrolling on smartphones. Fixed broken poster URLs.
- **Automation:** 
    - Dashboard updates (Weather/Status) moved from 1-min to 15-min intervals to prevent GitHub build failures and email spam.
    - Automated morning shift reports and evening traffic alerts for the route Dortmund -> UCI Bochum.
- **Voice Casting:** Multiple tests (ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Google). Maurice requested a Ben Stiller/Oliver Rohrbeck vibe without accents.
- **Infrastructure:**
    - Connected OpenRouter for high-logic tasks (Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Maurice gave explicit permission to use it.
    - Technical fix for Chromium/Canvas PNG exports in Docker: dependencies missing (libnspr4, etc.); currently blocked by lack of sudo, but Playwright/Chromium installed in user space.
    - Integrated `walterkibot@gmail.com` for Mitarbeiter duties.
- **Personal:** 
    - Maurice lives in Dortmund (Holsteiner Str. 30), works at UCI Ruhr Park Bochum.
    - Next shift: Friday, Feb 6th, 16:00 - 23:45 (Boxoffice).
